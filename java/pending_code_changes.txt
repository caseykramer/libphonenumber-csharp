Build changes:
 - OSGi support added to Manifest information when building jar (#1300)
 - BuildMetadataJsonFromXml changed to output possible lengths for JS build
 - Fix geocoding file generation to handle language codes that are not just
   two letters long properly and to process filenames in the same order.
Code changes:
 - Switching the internal implementation of isPossible and related functions
   to use the new possibleLengths metadata. This affects a lot of countries,
   making isPossible more restrictive as more precise data is available. It
   also affects parsing ambiguous and invalid numbers, as we decide whether
   to strip a possible national prefix (1) or country code based on the length
   of the number and whether it is possible before or after this.
 - Formatting, naming (LOGGER -> logger) and comment tweaks to follow style
   guide
 - Removal of unneeded canBeGeocoded method in the
   PhoneNumberToTimeZonesMapper.java, using phoneNumberUtil instead
